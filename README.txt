You will need:
sudo apt install ffmpeg cmake librsvg2-dev libx264-dev libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libglib2.0-dev #and maybe some other things i forgot?

oh, yeah, also a setup of microtex. I'll have to work on the way i integrate it, it sucks atm

then just run the build_and_run script, it should do everything for you
