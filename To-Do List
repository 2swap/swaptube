To-Do List

	Scene/Project Specific
Steady State Verifier
Rubik's Scene
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?
c4_graph_scene re-renders all of its subscenes every frame, because it reconstructs them every frame, even though none of them will change.
Prepare c4 scene for steady state diagrams

	End Product Quality
Decrease Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Audio and video time drift

	Simplify and Abstract
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
Abstract out the idea of a project? The Project constructor makes the writer and stuff?
