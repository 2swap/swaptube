To-Do List

Composite Child can't own its own transitions?? this is a bug i think
Three-dimension scene is a total mess, refactor. Also refactor its interface with Graph/GraphScene
Graph has random pointers all over and it probably shouldn't
Perhaps check for correctness of the number of render/inject_audio calls before running somehow?
Abstract out a ParentScene class so that non-parent classes need not implement parenty functions
Rubik's Scene
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?
Prepare c4 scene for steady state diagrams
Decrease Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
Abstract out the idea of a project? The Project constructor makes the writer and stuff?
Test that using new runtimeerror structure, we observe that the video saves on runtime error
