To-Do List

	Scene/Project Specific
Steady State Verifier
Rubik's Scene
Lambda Calc Scene
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?
c4_graph_scene re-renders all of its subscenes every frame, because it reconstructs them every frame, even though none of them will change.
Prepare c4 scene for steady state diagrams

	Graphics
3D Clipping Ordering by Projected Distance

	End Product Quality
Decrease Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Better checking for viewability on OLED screens
More aliasing
Audio and video time drift

	Debt Cleanup
Fix yucky interface between main.cpp and .active_project.cpp
Project should define resolution and framerate, not main file

	Simplify and Abstract
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
Change the CompositeScene into a generic 2d-scene
Add a mechanism to set integer pointers to slate values
