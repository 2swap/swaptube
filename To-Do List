To-Do List

Three-dimension scene is a total mess, refactor. Also refactor its interface with Graph/GraphScene
Graph has random pointers all over and it probably shouldn't
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?
Prepare c4 scene for steady state diagrams
increase Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
