To-Do List

	Scene/Project Specific
Steady State Verifier
Rubik's Scene
Lambda Calc Scene
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?

	Graphics
3D Clipping Ordering by Projected Distance
unproject and intersection_point functions should be combined

	End Product Quality
Decrease Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Better checking for viewability on OLED screens
More aliasing
Fix the subtitle splitter
Audio and video time drift

	Debt Cleanup
Fix yucky interface between main.cpp and .active_project.cpp
Project should define resolution and framerate, not main file
Color Class

	Simplify and Abstract
Give each scene its own DAG
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
Change the CompositeScene into a generic 2d-scene
Allow for slate values of non-real-scalar types (vectors, quaternions, etc)
Add a mechanism to set integer pointers to slate values
