To-Do List

Composite- specify the center of the subscene instead of the top left?
Make scene definition take the fraction of the screen, instead of a full size in pixels?
Three-dimension scene is a total mess, refactor. Also refactor its interface with Graph/GraphScene
Smart exit on failout?
replace bespoke failout function with c++ style error throwing
Graph has random pointers all over and it probably shouldn't
Perhaps check for correctness of the number of render/inject_audio calls before running somehow?
Abstract out a ParentScene class so that non-parent classes need not implement parenty functions
Rename subscene and superscene

	Scene/Project Specific
Steady State Verifier
Rubik's Scene
Scenes for making line graphs, bar charts, etc?
c4_graph_scene re-renders all of its subscenes every frame, because it reconstructs them every frame, even though none of them will change.
Prepare c4 scene for steady state diagrams

	End Product Quality
Decrease Bitrate? Somehow fight the youtube compression algorithm?
Audio and video time drift

	Simplify and Abstract
Abstract out the idea of Coordinate Systems
Abstract out the idea of a project? The Project constructor makes the writer and stuff?
